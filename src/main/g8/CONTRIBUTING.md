# Welcome to $name$

We follow the standard GitHub [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#fork--pull) approach 
to pull requests. Just fork the official repo, develop in a branch, and submit a PR!

## Ticket Guidelines

* __Bugs__:
    * Contain steps to reproduce.
    * Contain a code sample that exhibits the error.
    * Inform us if the issue is blocking you with no visible workaround
        * This will give the ticket priority

* __Features__
    * Show a code example of how that feature would be used.

## Contribution Guidelines

* __All code PRs should__:
    * Have a meaningful commit message description.
    * Comment important things.
    * Include unit tests (positive and negative).
    * Pass CI, which automatically runs when your pull request is submitted.

* __Be prepared to discuss/argue-for your changes if you want them merged__! You will probably need to refactor so your 
changes fit into the larger codebase.
* __If your code is hard to unit test, and you don't want to unit test it, that's ok__. But be prepared to argue why 
that's the case!
* __It's entirely possible your changes won't be merged__, or will get ripped out later. This is also the case for 
maintainer changes!
* __Even a rejected/reverted PR is valuable__! It helps explore the solution space, and know what works and what doesn't. 
For every line in the repo, at least three lines were tried, committed, and reverted/refactored, and more than 10 were 
tried without committing.
* __Feel free to send Proof-Of-Concept PRs__ that you don't intend to get merged.

In case of any questions, don't hesitate to ask on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/$contributorUsername$/$name$)
